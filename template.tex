\begin{abstract}
Since the employment of deep learning model in video salient detection, the accuracy and efficiency of the recent approaches have reached a very high level. However, as for the exploration of motion features and spatiotemporal fusion, these still exists scope for improvement. In this paper, we propose a densely motion feature enhancement network for video salient object detection. Firstly, a densely motion feature enhancement module is employed to solve improve the robustness of inter-frame motion features. In this module, we refine the motion features by dense integration of infer-frame deep features and historic salieny supervision. After that, to explore the spatiotemporal contextual relationship, we propose a sptiotemporal cross-attention block, which selectively integrates the both spatial and temporal features by computing the weights of these features. The experiments demonstrate that our approach has the competitive performances on 7 widely used datasets, i.e. ViSal, SegTrack and VOS. Meanwhile, the proposed network is an end-to-end framework without extra supplementary in both training and testing phases. As for the community of unsupervised video object segmentation, we also achieve the competitive results DAVIS dataset against the state-of-the-arts.

\section{Introduction}
The purpose of salient object detection (SOD) is to focus on the most attractive objects or regions in an image or video and then highlight them from the complex background. As the trait of this community, it usually is treated as the pre-processing to support other visual tasks, such as visual tracking, image retrieval and action recognition. According to the input of frameworks, SOD can be categoried into image salient object detection and video salient object detection. In this paper, our research emphasizes on the more complex video salient object detection.

The development of video saliency approaches can be divided into two stages. The first stage is based on hand-crafted features and some heuristics \cite{xxx}. As the shoratage of robust motion features and efficient spatiotemporal models, these methods are not able to handle complex video scenes, such as motion blur, low contrast and so on. With the employment of deep learning models, especially fully convolutional networks (FCNs)\cite{xxx}, the accuracy and efficiency of this field have achieved a top level. Moreover, the recent approaches, PDB \cite{xxx} and SSAV \cite{xxx}, outperform previous methods with a largin margin, by using the dilated convolutions and LSTM-based module to extract the robust spatiotemporal features. Under this kind of senario, to improve the accuracy on these approaches, we need to further refine the motion features and explore the relationship between spatial and temporal information.

Through the analysis of the intermediate results in deep FCN model, we notice that there exists the fluctuation of feature values between two consecutive frames in few video sequences. As shown in Fig.\ref{results}, the first row is the consecutive input frames. The second row and the third row are the energy visualization of the corresponding intermediate feature maps and final saliency maps (with sigmoid activation), respectively. Compared with colar bar beside the energy visualization, the feature values of the second frame is obviously smaller than the first ones. Moreover, some feature values are less than one, which leads to the loss of the salient object in the saliency map.  

Notice the previous the state-of-the-arts (i.e., PDB and SSAV), their frameworks consists of spatial learning block and temporal learning block. The former one is to extract the static features in an single frame, the latter one is to refine the dynamic features after the spatial learning block. This kind of framework is efficient and can extract robust spatiotemporal features, but it still does not fully explore the contextual dependencies between spatial and temporal features, which is able to produce more robust fusing spatotemporal features and further improve the quality of saliency maps.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep framework, called densely motion feature enhancement network (MEN). Observed by the fluctuation of feature values in Fig.\ref{results}, we try to exploit the features of previous frame to aggregate the current ones. Therefore, an inter-frame motion features enhancement module is introduced to refine the motion information. In this module, the recursively aggregated feature maps and historic saliency supervision are employed to provide sufficient motion information for current frame. Besides, to explore the contextual dependencies between the spatial and temporal features, we introduce a sptiotemporal cross-attention block. Inspired by position attention in \cite{}, the proposed attention block generates the weight of feature by any positions with similar features from both spatial and temporal information. Togethter with motion features enhancement module, our MEN is able to effetively revise the fluctuation situation and produce more robust spatiotemporal feature for video saliency estiamtion.

In summary, this paper can conclude the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item We proposed a end-to-end densely motion feature enhancement network, without any extra supplementary information in training and testing stage. Additionally, this approach achieve competitive performance in the field of video salient object detection (VSOD) and unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS). 
  \item We introduce an inter-frame motion features enhancement module, which refines the motion features by the recursively aggregated feature maps and historic saliency supervision.
  \item To fully exploit the spatitemporal information and explore their contextual dependencies, a spatiotemporal cross-attention block is proposed to combine the spatial and temporal information together.	  
\end{itemize}
 

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Video salient object detection}

With the introduction of deep learning methods, we can divide prvious video saliency approaches into two phases, which are non-deep learning approaches and deep learning-based approaches. The formers are based on hand-crafted features (e.g., color contrast, texture, optical flow) and heuristic models (e.g., gesidesc distance, center-surround contrast). As the exploitation of optical flow and optimization models, these approaches are usually time-consuming. Moreover, they also cannot conduct the complex video scenes such as motion blur, low contrast, occlusion, because of the limitation of hand-crafted features. With the success of deep learning in many visual tasks, this community also starts to widely use deep learning \cite{A,B,C,D,F}. At the beginning, as the shortage of training data, weakly supervised method \cite{scnn} and data synthetic \cite{fcn} are employed to supply pixel-wise labels. In the aspect of deep saliency models, dilated convolutions and LSTM-based structures are introduced to retain sufficient feature scale and extract motion information, respectively. For example, PDB \cite{pdb} extracts spatial features by pyramid dilated convolutions and obtains temporal features by deeper bi-directional ConvLSTM structure. Based on PDB, SSAV \cite{ssav} further introduces eye fixation records for network training and proposes a saliency-shift-aware convLSTM module to capture video saliency dynamics. Additionally, DLVS \cite{scnn} proposes a saliency detection network by stepwise extracting the static and dynamic information. Li et al. \cite{fgrne} subtly combines optical flow and short connection structure \cite{dss} to propose a flow guided recurrent neural encoder framework. SCOM \cite{scom} and STCR \cite{scom} build different optimization models, but the employment of deep features make them achieve good performances. 

\subsection{Unsupervised video object segmentation}

Video saliency detection is very similar with Unsupervised video segmentation. The former one is to generate the probability value of each pixel in video frames, the latter one is to classify each pixel. Like the development of video saliency, early video segmentations mainly integrates hand-carfted features and heuristics, which include clustering \cite{keuper2015motion,brox2010object,chang2013video}, objectness \cite{lee2011key,ma2012maximum,koh2017primary,li2018instance} and saliency guidance \cite{hu2018unsupervised,wang2015consistent,wang2015robust}. As the limiting robustness of hand-crafted features and the low speed of optical flow extraction, these approaches have gradually reached the bottleneck. To obtain more robust spatiotemporal features, recent works begin to build their frameworks with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). FusionSeg \cite{jain2017fusionseg} proposes a two-stream framework, which extracts spatial and temporal cues, respectively. In \cite{perazzi2017learning,Tokmakov_2017_CVPR,Cheng_2017_ICCV}, optical flow is widely used to extract motion information for video segmentation. Further, FGRNE \cite{fgrne} incorporate LSTM and optical flow to generate robust motion features. Latest, AGS \cite{AGS} collects UVOS-aware human attention data and then train the attention-guided object segmentation network with this kind of data. In this paper, we also treat video segmentation as an extra validation task, which proves our approache is feasible in this community.  

\subsection{Visual attention}

Attention mechanism is to compute the weights from different and complex information. It usually is used for selecting and fusing features in many visual tasks, such as natural language processing \cite{lin2017structured, vaswani2017attention}, image caption \cite{chen2017sca,lu2016hierarchical}, image segmentaion \cite{fu2019dual,yuan2018ocnet}, etc. In particular, the work \cite{yuan2018ocnet} proposes an object context pooling scheme by exploiting self-attention module, whose principle is to compute similarites of all pixels and them selectively integrates them. DANet \cite{fu2019dual} further propose two kinds of attention modules: position attention module (PAM) and channel attention module (CAM). The two modules can explore the contextual dependencies in FCN framework. Inspired by their PAM, we build a cross-attention module to extract the contextual information in spatial and temporal cues. 

\section{Densely motion feature enhancement network}

\subsection{Overview}

The proposed framwork mainly consists of four components. It includes backbone network, initial motion extraction, inter-frame motion features enhancement module and spatiotemporal cross-attention block. Given the video frames, the spatial features are firstly extracted by the backbone network. Here, to fully exploit the multi-scale features, we follow the feature encoding method \cite{fu2019dual}
